<h1>Folders</h1>

Each folder is described as follows. 

<b>CloudSSF (source) </b>- it contains the source files for the prototype tool. The tool has been developed in C# and its project can be opened using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.

<b>CloudSSF (bin) </b> - binary files and dependencies to run the tool; we tested it with Windows 10. 

<b>Experimental Data</b> - contains the applications used to run the tests and the LOGs and RESULTS obtained in each run. 
 

We believe all files needed to replicate the experiments are herein available.
